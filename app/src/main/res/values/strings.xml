        "The Afghan Girl\n\n"

        "The young Afghan refugee who stared from the cover of National Geographic in June 1985 "
        "was an enigma for 17 years. What was her name? Had she survived? Photographer Steve "
        "McCurry joined a crew from National Geographic Television and Film to methodically search "
        "for her. They showed her photograph around the refugee camp in Pakistan where McCurry had "
        "encountered her as a school gir in December 1984. Finally, after some false leads, a man "
        "who had also lived in the camp as a child recognized her. Yes, she was alive. She had "
        "left the camp many years before and was living in the mountains Tora Bora region of "
        "Afghanistan. He said he could find her, and three days later he and a friend brought her "
        "back to the camp. There, the remarkable history of this woman, Sharbat Gula, began to be "
        "told.\n\n"

        "A Life Revealed\n\n"

        "She remembers the moment. The photographer took her picture. She remembers her anger. The "
        "man was a stranger. She had never been photographed before. Until they met again 17 years "
        "later, she had not been photographed since.\n\n"


        "The photographer remembers the moment too. The light was soft. The refugee camp in "
        "Pakistan was a sea of tents. Inside the school tent he noticed her first. Sensing her "
        "shyness, he approached her last. She told him he could take her picture. \"I didn't think "
        "the photography of the girl would be different from anything else I shot that day,\" he "
        "recalls of that morning in 1984 spent documenting the ordeal of Afghanistan's refugees.\n\n"
